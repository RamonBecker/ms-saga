# üìò Microservices with Orchestrated Saga

This repository presents a personal project focused on handling **distributed transactions** using the **Orchestrated Saga Pattern**. The goal is to build a robust microservices architecture capable of handling failures and maintaining data consistency without relying on the 2PC protocol.

## üìä Architecture Flowcharts

Below are the main diagrams that illustrate the behavior of the system using the **Orchestrated Saga Pattern** and the interactions between the microservices involved:

## üß± Project Overview

This project implements a microservices architecture that simulates a complete flow of ordering, payment, and inventory update. Coordination between services is managed through the **Orchestrated Saga Pattern**, using asynchronous communication via **Apache Kafka**.

---

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Apache Kafka** (event-driven communication)
- **PostgreSQL** (relational database)
- **MongoDB** (non-relational database for orders)
- **Docker** & **docker-compose** (containerized environment)
- **Lombok**, **Spring Data**, **Spring Cloud Stream**

---

## üì¶ Architecture Structure

The architecture is composed of 5 microservices:

### 1. **Saga Orchestrator**
- Manages the distributed transaction flow
- Controls the order of operations and executes compensating actions if a failure occurs

### 2. **Order Service**
- Receives order creation requests
- Stores data in MongoDB
- Emits events to start the saga

### 3. **Payment Service**
- Processes payment attempts
- Performs compensation if needed

### 4. **Inventory Service**
- Updates product stock
- Validates availability
- Compensates reservation in case of rollback

### 5. **Product Service**
- Maintains product information

---

## üîÑ Features Implemented

- Asynchronous processing of **distributed transactions**
- Execution and orchestration of **sagas with rollback**
- Event-based communication using **Apache Kafka**
- Distributed data storage with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- Docker containers for running the architecture locally
- Use of unique identifiers and **idempotency control** to avoid inconsistencies

---

## üì£ Apache Kafka

**Apache Kafka** is a distributed event streaming platform used for **asynchronous communication between microservices**. In this project, Kafka acts as the **message broker** responsible for managing the events that trigger each stage of the Orchestrated Saga.

Kafka is used to:

- Publish events across services involved in the saga
- Decouple producers and consumers
- Enable reactivity and scalability in the orchestration
- Control rollback flows in failure scenarios

Kafka provides **high performance**, **fault tolerance**, **partitioning**, and **event persistence**, making it ideal for event-driven architectures.
